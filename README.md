# Machine Learning C++

This project is a way for me to learn the basics of how machine learning works at a low level view. It is also a great way to improve at C++.

The final project is ment to fulfill the following requirements:
- Implement ML algorithms
- Be able to save current network state / load it from a file
- Provide visualization widgets using SFML
- Be able to load training data from various sources
- Be able to classify as well as generate data
